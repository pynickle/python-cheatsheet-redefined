**Notes**:

- **Every code snippet here can run independently (some need the files provided by this repo)**
- **If you want to copy the code, use [command to code](https://pynickle.github.io/ctc.html)(Temporarily unavailable)**
- **You can use GETREADME.py to download README.md from the repository (Chinese or English, with or not with command line prefixes is up to you!)**
