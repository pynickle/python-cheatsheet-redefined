# Python Standard Libraries Cheatsheet

Depend on Python v3.9.8

All code snippets have been tested to ensure they work properly.

Fork me on [GitHub](https://github.com/pynickle/python-cheatsheet-redefined).

- [中文](README-zh-cn.md)
- [English](README.md)

**Notes**:

- **Every code snippet here can run independently (some need the files provided by this repo)**
- **You can use readme_snatcher.py to download README.md from the repository (Chinese or English, with or not with command line prefixes is up to you!)**
